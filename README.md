# ratamero.com

it's-a me, Luciano! this is the (very poorly put together) codebase for my personal site and blog :]

this is made with SvelteKit, and currently uses Bun for dependencies and bundling. npm **should** work fine, but use it at your own risk.

## developing

to run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the development server

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev:only

# or, if you're me (hi, future me!), you might want to copy the md files directly form Obsidian with
bun run dev
```
