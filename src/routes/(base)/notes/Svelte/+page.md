[Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is currently my go-to frontend framework. it's intuitive, fast, and comes with a lot of basic modules for everyday tasks.

I've made a small, but comprehensive, [series of videos about Svelte 5 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAsITVlqa_GRtVaMKx-aut0tZyhizmvpZ). it's in Brazilian (not a typo), so if you can't speak Brazilian, then do like we do and enable captions :]
