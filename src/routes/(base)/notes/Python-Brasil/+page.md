Python Brasil is the biggest [Python](/notes/Python) conference in the country, and one of the most fun and informative times I've had in my life. the [Python](/notes/Python) community is amazing, always helpful, sincere, and friendly. it happens every year, and I've been to a lot of them since I started programming in 2010.

if you have any interest in the language, and have the time and resources to go, I totally recommend it. it's always a fun time, and we would most likely meet there :]
