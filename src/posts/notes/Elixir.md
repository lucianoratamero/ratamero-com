> Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications. Elixir strikes a balance between expressiveness and readability. It runs on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. These capabilities allow Elixir developers to be productive in several domains, such as web development, embedded software, data pipelines, and multimedia processing, across a wide range of industries.

I'm currently learning Elixir because of my interest in functional programming and in new ideas for the web that are being introduced by the [Phoenix](../notes/Phoenix) framework. so far, it's been really fun, and I've left some [first impressions](../first-impressions-of-Elixir) in a blog post :]
