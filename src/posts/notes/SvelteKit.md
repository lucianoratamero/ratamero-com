[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is a fullstack web framework based on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). And I love it so much ðŸ’–   
   
It's no secret that I've been in love with Svelte as soon as I started playing with it in 2019, when they released the v3. Svelte is really, **really** easy to use and configure, and has good solutions for most of the things I hate about React.   
   
The problem that SvelteKit came to solve was that, before it, there were multiple ways to build a Svelte app or component. You had Sapper, which was closer to what Next.js is to React, and we had the Svelte basic template, which delivered a SPA experience.   
   
While there are still other frameworks that use Svelte as a base (Routify, for example), SvelteKit is useful not only for complex apps, but for making standalone components. Not only that, but using specific [adapters](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters), you can deploy your app anywhere, from Vercel, to CloudFlare Workers, to Github Pages, or even as a standalone Node.js app.   
   
So yeah, it's pretty great. 12/10 would use again
