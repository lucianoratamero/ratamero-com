Phoenix is the biggest framework for building web sites with [Elixir](../notes/Elixir). it's known for resilience, ease of use, and innovative solutions.   
   
the thing that brought me to Phoenix was its LiveView feature. it's a feature in which you write frontend reactive apps by writing components on the backend and exchanging messages via websockets. it's really impressive, so I really want to understand how it works, so it can be another tool on my tool belt.
