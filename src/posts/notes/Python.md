when I started learning programming seriously, [Python](../notes/Python) was my first choice. it's really easy to learn, read and write, while being really powerful and enabling you to make anything from simple scripts to huge apps.   
   
I became more of a frontend developer after the years because of my visual inclinations, but I'm my heart is pythonista. I met a lot of friends while learning it, going to conferences and meetings, and I even got some job offers because of it too.   
   
currently, it's my second programming language, losing only to [JavaScript](../notes/JavaScript) - not by choice, but because of my frontend experience.
