Today I learned of a really simple way to make scrollbars functional, but hidden :]   
   
It's really simple, you just need to add a couple of rules into your CSS and you'll be good to go:   
   
```css
.hide-scrollbar {
  -ms-overflow-style: none;  /* IE and Edge */  
  scrollbar-width: none;  /* Firefox */
}

/* Chrome, Safari and old Opera */
.hide-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; }
```
   
   
This is really useful for when you have an off-canvas panel (or anything absolute/fixed positioned), and you want it to scroll by itself if it has too much content.
